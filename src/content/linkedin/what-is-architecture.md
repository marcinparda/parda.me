Ever wondered what really counts as **"architecture"** in frontend development? 🤔

I used to think picking React vs. Vue was an architectural decision. Turns out, it might be more of an _implementation detail_ and architecture is something **deeper**.

Here's a perspective from Martin Fowler website: _"The important stuff. The stuff that matters. The stuff that's hard to change."_

Mine version of this quote would be:

> _"The important **technical** stuff. The stuff that matters for **business and users**. The stuff that's **hard to change**."_

With this in mind, React vs Vue is more of an implementation detail, where users don't really care which one you used, as long as the app **works for them**. "Works for them" might mean that app is **fast on initial load** or is fast when navigating between pages with longer initial load time. So what is important here is **SPA vs SSR**, React vs Vue is just aftermath of this decision.

I am simplifing of course, because it's linkedin post 😊. If you want to read more how I see software architecture, please check out my article. I explored this topic, drawing from "Head First Software Architecture" and added my thoughts how it applies to Frontend development.

What's your take on this? 💭 Where do you draw the movable line what's **architecture decision** and what's **implementation detail**?
