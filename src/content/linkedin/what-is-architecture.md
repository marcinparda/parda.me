Ever wondered what really counts as "architecture" in frontend development? 🤔

I used to think picking React vs. Vue was an architectural decision. Turns out, it might be more of an implementation detail and architecture is something deeper.

Here's a perspective from Martin Fowler website: "The important stuff. The stuff that matters. The stuff that's hard to change."

Mine version of this quote would be:
"The important technical stuff. The stuff that matters for business and users. The stuff that's hard to change."

With this in mind, React vs Vue is more of an implementation detail, where users don't really care which one you used, as long as the app works for them. "Works for them" might mean that app is fast on initial load or is fast when navigating between pages with longer initial load time. So what is important here is SPA vs SSR, React vs Vue is just aftermath of this decision.

I am simplifing of course, because it's linkedin post. If you want to read more how I see software architecture, please check out my article. I explored this topic, drawing from "Head First Software Architecture" and added my thoughts how it applies to Frontend development.

What's your take on this? Where do you draw the movable line what's architecture decision and what's implementation detail?
